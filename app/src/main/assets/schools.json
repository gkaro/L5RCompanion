The Hiruma relied on this school for over 300 years, until ancient scrolls of the lost Hiruma Bushi school were finally recovered from the Shadowlands.

However, at some point the training at Shiro Giji took on a darker and less honorable tone, focusing on the use of truly heinous methods such as sabotage and assassination. The final turning point seems to have been the decision to covertly manufacture and use gaijin pepper, whose secrets were discovered after the defeat of the gaijin in the Battle of White Stag.\n\nThe students of Shiro Giji took to calling themselves ‘Harriers’ to distinguish their methods from the somewhat more honorable tactics of other Daidoji Scouts. With time, the rulers of the family came to see the Harriers as a separate organization, a hand-picked band of men and women who would do anything and sacrifice any amount of their own honor for the greater good of the Crane. They carefully concealed the Harriers’ existence and methods from the rest of the clan, ensuring the leadership of the Crane could maintain honor and propriety. In this way the Harriers covertly served the Crane clan for many generations.\n\nThe organization was finally exposed during the socalled War of Silk and Steel between the Dragon and Crane in the late twelfth century. Crane Champion Doji Domotai was outraged by the Harriers’ activities and ordered the entire group disbanded, an order reluctantly obeyed by the Daidoji daimyo.",

In particular the rivalry between students of the Mirumoto Bush School and the Kakita Bushi School, the greatest advocates of Kakita’s “On soul, one sword” philosophy, is heated even during times of peace. Many opponents, anticipating the reputation of the Dragon as erratic, are surprised t face the calm, implacable Mirumoto as an enemy, a mistake that has cost more than one samurai victory on the field o battle. The Mirumoto Bushi School focuses on the mechanica benefits of wielding two weapons simultaneously, both i forgiving the penalties associated with doing so and improving the benefits. It also increases the samurai’s Armor TN an grants him additional attacks at an increased rate due to the availability of his weapons.",

Their primary home is Morning Frost Castle, but they also have several lesser dojo scattered through the most remote and inhospitable corners of the Dragon lands. The Master Sensei are very few in number, seldom exceeding two dozen in total, and those who would join their company must meet with their personal approval. Some Mirumoto samurai have spent decades struggling to prove their worthiness to the Master Sensei, while others have been admitted on their first application. Although the nature of the Master Sensei is more amenable to those who have followed the ways of the Taoist Swordsmen, they do not play favorites and more than one Swordmaster or Niten practitioner has joined their ranks.\n\nThe Master Sensei are isolated even by Dragon standards, and rare indeed is it for one of them to leave their remote dojo and visit the rest of the Dragon lands, let alone the Empire as a whole. However, on the few occasions they do emerge to influence the world outside, their impact is always profound.",

Only a truly unique commander with a powerful destiny can challenge the Tactical Master in his own realm and hope to compete.\n\nThe Akodo Tactical Master studies every notable battle in Rokugani history. He examines how the Lion have handled every situation—and just as importantly, how the enemy attempted to find weakness in the Lion Clan’s traditional plans. He learns to adapt, react, and change his battle plans to meet every eventuality. Even knowledge from outside Rokugan’s borders is not wholly anathema to him, since he can use such intelligence to",

Although this leaves the Matsu vulnerable to an opponent’s attacks, the philosophy behind the Techniques is that an opponent who has been defeated has no opportunity to retaliate. It is for this reason that the legions of the Matsu family are so feared on the battlefield: how can one defeat an enemy who does not care if he lives or dies, so long as you are defeated first The Matsu Techniques focus heavily upon the Full Attack Stance, which makes them heavy-hitting opponents who have to position themselves carefully in order to prevent an opponent from exploiting their lower Armor TN.

Many other clans train animals for combat, but the Matsu Beastmasters take a personal approach to each beast. The lion is a savage creature that fights as part of a group called a pride. The Beastmaster adopts lion warcats into his own pride, bonding emotionally and spiritually to each warcat that charges into battle beside him. The Beastmaster treats his warcats as equals, fostering a sense of family and belonging.\n\nThe communication between Beastmaster and warcat borders on the mystical. Once a warcat has trained with her Beastmaster, she can sense what he wants without any words or gestures. However, this intense empathy between human and predatory animal can sometimes hinder the Beastmaster’s social abilities among humans. Most Beastmasters tend to stay amongst their own kind rather than share the company of “normal” samurai. Some Lion generals have raised concerns the Beastmasters may become too feral, to which the Beastmasters retort that they are still Matsu above all. Only the Matsu, they say, are strong and proud enough to maintain their hold on Bushido and human traditions under such pressures.",

Unfortunately, that recognition does little to assist in understanding the Henshin’s ways.\n\nThe Henshin follow the Path of Man as revealed by Shiba to Asako. By developing perfect unity with the universe, tricking the Elements and learning their secrets, the Henshin can attain absolute perfection of the soul, which in turn grants divinity. The Henshin are essentially monks of a sort, and as apprentices they are known as michibuku. Once they have learned the secrets of the Path of Man, they are inducted into the ranks of the secretive fushihai, the true masters of the Henshin order. The fushihai hold deep knowledge of the universe and are essentially immortal, able to live far beyond the normal mortal span. Some among the fushihai ascend to the Celestial Heavens upon their mortal death, becoming minor Fortunes and validating the Path of Man.",

There are fanciful tales of Scorpion infiltrators so skilled they could convince a doting mother to place an entire family’s welfare into their hands.

  "description": "Although the Unicorn Clan is known for its cavalry, the tactics of Shinjos children also require infantry to serve as a base of maneuver and to fix enemy infantry in place.\n\nThe need for such tactics became clear during the clans years of wandering in gaijin lands, most notably during the 200 years after Shinjo disappeared in battle against the Lying Darkness. During those two centuries the clan fought a variety of opponents, many of whom could not be defeated with a simple cavalry charge. To deal with this problem, the Unicorn developed a force of mounted infantry soldiers who rode horses while the army maneuvered, but then dismounted and fought on foot.\n\nFrom the beginning, this force attracted a disproportionate numberof men from the Otaku family, who were forbidden by family tradition from fighting on horseback alongside the Otaku women. In fact, it was one such man, Otaku Buki, who devised the first specific Techniques for the mounted infantry, drawing inspiration from the gaijin fighting techniques he had seen.\n\nOver time, the School which developed from Bukis techniques came to be known as the Otaku Mounted Infantry School (in modern times, the Utaku Mounted Infantry); although it drew recruits from all of the families, the Otaku men always predominated. However, it remained a distinctly secondary choice for most Unicorn, since the cavalry schools were considered the premier symbols of Unicorn might, and enrollment in the school was never as high as its sensei (or the Unicorn generals) would have liked. That finally changed, however, after the disgrace of the Shinjo family during the Hidden Emperor era. The Shinjo Bushi School had always been the preferred choice of Otaku/Utaku men who wished to serve in battle, but after the revelation that many of the Shinjo had served the Kolat, a rift opened between the families and the bulk of the Utaku males began training in the Mounted Infantry School instead. This resulted in a sharp expansion in the overall size and strength of the Unicorn infantry forces, and many samurai in the other clans finally began to take note of the school and its students.",

  "description": "Affinity/Deficiency: Earth / Air\n\nThe Horiuchi family was formed late in the history of the Unicorn, but the shugenja school that bears their name in modern times has an ancient history with roots from long before the Great Clan’s return to their ancestral home in Rokugan. During their travels outside the borders of the Emerald Empire, the Unicorn discovered many different methods and styles of magic among both their allies and enemies, incorporating them into a single method. After the Horiuchi family was formed they became some of the foremost practitioners of the meishodo method and in modern times the school bears the Horiuchi name.\n\nThe original gaijin sorcerers who created name magic could notspeak to the elemental kami and had no direct access to the gods. Instead, they forged amulets of power that could simulate magical effects by invoking the true names of the elements. When the Unicorn studied this magic, they realized it trapped a kami into the item, forcing it to reproduce a single effect whenever the sorcerer focused his will into it. The Unicorn changed and adapted the process to fit their own beliefs. Their meishodo amulets no longer trap the kami, but instead appeal to the elements surrounding the amulet to perform the desired magical effects.\n\nHowever, somewhat like the gaijin originals, a Unicorn meishodo amulet contains only one unalterable effect that can be invoked in this manner.\n\nMeishodo is a Unicorn secret, jealously guarded by all of the clan. Meishodo sacrifices power for speed, using a brief incantation rather than an extended dialogue with the kami, and speed has always been an important aspect of the Unicorn approach to life.\n\nDepending on the era of play, this school is known as either the Horiuchi Shugenja School or simply as the Meishodo Shugenja School—in the earlier eras it is taught and maintained by the Iuchi family",

When the Moto were still nomads, they paid homage to these Lords of Death out of both reverence and fear. However, when the Lady Shinjo taught the Moto there were gods who could show compassion and reward loyalty, they forsook their old devotion and joined the Unicorn. For centuries, the enraged Lords of Death sought their wayward worshippers, finally locating them in the Empire of Rokugan and afflicting them with ill fortune and misery, a kharmic phenomenon sometimes referred to as the Moto Curse. It was not until the days of Moto Gaheris, near the end of the War of Spirits, that the gods were contacted directly and a bargain was struck: the Lords of Death would stay their wrath and in exchange the Moto would resume their worship.\n\nAfter the reunion of the Moto and the Lords of Death, worship of these gods spreads to other families within the Unicorn, especially once they are elevated to the position of lesser Fortunes in the cosmology of Rokugan. Holding sway in the Realm of Waiting, they pass judgment on the dead who await reincarnation, and their power even attracts a few worshippers from other clans. The Death Priests who revere the Shi-Tien Yen-Wang are singularly focused and disturbing men and women; they bring the blessings of death to those who are determined to be enemies of the Unicorn, and their prowess in battle is something other clans quickly learn to fear.",

Although many samurai condemned this mercenary practice, no one could deny Tsuruchi prowess and few clan magistrates refused to employ them.\n\nSince the Tsuruchi family joined the Mantis clan, its two iconic pursuits have separated somewhat, becoming distinct schools which young Tsuruchi may choose between depending on their aptitudes and preferences. The majority choose to pursue a career as soldiers and archers within the Mantis military (the Tsuruchi Archer School), but a select few continue the family’s original tradition by becoming members of the small but famed Tsuruchi Bounty Hunter School.\n\nMembers of the Tsuruchi Bounty Hunters are usually treated as clan magistrates within the Tsuruchi provinces and often within the Mantis Clan’s territory as a whole.\n\nThe contract between Tsuruchi and the Emerald Champion still exists and thus the family can impart authority to a select number of students that is roughly equivalent to an Emerald Magistrate, at least insofar as the ability to apprehend known criminals. The Tsuruchi are extremely cautious in whom they trust such authority, however, since they are keenly aware the contract could be nullified if it is abused or misused.\n\nTsuruchi Bounty Hunters traverse the Empire in search of fugitives, those accused of crimes by superior authorities who have escaped the justice they deserve. Although they can technically only hunt those decried by an Imperial authority, the Tsuruchi also accept individual bounties from clans or families who wish their assistance. Bounties are usually a number of koku equal to the Insight Rank of the target.\n\nThis fee is doubled if the target is a violent criminal or a shugenja, and may increase even further if special or unusual circumstances apply.",

Understanding the impact that trained courtiers could have on their mercantile interests, the Yoritomo developed a School to serve them i that regard. Although successful in business endeavors, the Yoritomo courtiers have only rarely made strides in court historically speaking, because of their brusque manner an dependence upon intimidation. Since their elevation to Grea Clan status, however, the increased clout the Mantis posses has diminished the need for these tactics, and the Yoritom Courtier School has begun to see more success in different political arenas. The Yoritomo Techniques specialize in intimidation and frankly, bullying. This makes them particularly effective when facing opponents unaccustomed to such tactics, or who are weak-willed. Unfortunately, more capable opponents such a the Crane or Scorpion may well be completely immune to Yoritomo’s primary abilities.",

This lack of bushi has been less of an issue since the family’s induction into the Mantis Clan, since the Yoritomo can supply ample forces to secure the Moshi homelands, but the family still prefers to have its most sacred locations defended by its own.\n\nThe bushi unit known as the Guardians of the Sun has evolved over the centuries. It is comprised of the finest Moshi warriors available and specializes not only in the defense of the homeland but also in the protection of the family’s shugenja. While not as well known as the Shiba or Daidoji yojimbo traditions, the Guardians of the Sun are nevertheless well regarded for their dedication and prowess.\n\nPrior to the Moshi joining the Mantis, this technique can also replace Insight Rank 1 for a Moshi bushi without a school",

The Imperial families are simply smaller than most of those who serve the clans, and their spheres of influence are relatively limited in comparison to their clan counterparts.\n\nEven the well-traveled Imperial heralds of the Miya family tend to stick to clearly defined travel routes, avoiding the Empire’s more remote districts for decades or even centuries at a time. In some cases this can lead to a misperception of the Imperials as dangerous or hostile individuals who desire only the obedience and submission of other samurai.\n\nWhile this is untrue in the main, there are a few individuals who prove it correct.\n\nScions of the Imperial families are utterly ruthless individuals who have mastered the manipulation of their own social standing to decimate their enemies. Standing against a scion in court is tantamount to ruination for all but the most skilled or highest-ranking samurai. These scions most often come from the Otomo family, which teaches their secret techniques in its most prestigious and elite dojo. Much more rarely, members of the Miya or Seppun families are permitted to train there as well.

This is essential both to their survival and to their ability to benefit their clan.",

Brothers of the Spider are merciless opponents with a well-deserved reputation for brutality. Their training includes devastating hand-to-hand styles and many heavy weapon techniques as well. Although some succumb to the Shadowlands Taint, many have remained pure simply because it has not suited their needs to draw upon the power of darkness.

When the Lost began to form communities, they saw these warriors as receiving special blessings from Fu Leng and revered them accordingly.\n\nAlthough the Spider Clan later made some attempts to form organized schools around the maho-bujin techniques, they were not successful – the ways of the maho-bujin can only be learned from the Taint itself. The Spider developed simpler techniques that could be taught normally.\n\nIn game mechanics terms, the maho-bujin “school” functions somewhat like a normal Advanced School, but it can only be learned by the Lost – who are NPCs, of course. Any Lost who is sufficiently powerful and useful to Jigoku can potentially become a maho-bujin, although thankfully few of them qualify for such attention from the Realm of Evil. The “school” has no real requirement other than that the recipient be powerful enough to be worthy of such dark blessings. Often, maho-bujin are Lost who were already trained as warriors – in such cases, the combination of their former knowledge and power of the maho-bujin techniques can be formidable indeed.",

The game design reflects this with a system which forces most ronin to rely chiefly on their innate capacities (represented by Skills) with only one or two Techniques.\n\nAlthough this approach is realistic for the setting, it does put ronin significantly behind clan characters (even Minor Clan characters) in terms of their game-mechanic capabilities. This can be frustrating for players who are running ronin characters. GMs who wish to mitigate this frustration can opt to make this generic ronin school available for play. Although a generic school does not really fit the concept of what schools are supposed to represent in the world of Rokugan, it does allow greater options for players, which is a virtue in itself. GMs can thus have the freedom to decide whether they wish to focus their campaigns more on setting authenticity at the expense of game-balance, or more on game-balance and maintaining fairness between players.\n\nAlthough this school is intended primarily to represent ronin, it can also be used to represent any other situation in which a character could have martial training without access to a named bushi school. For example, it could represent the training of Great Clan samurai who belong to minor vassal families without access to their clans main dojo. It could also represent Minor Clan samurai in clans like the Fox, Dragonfly, Oriole, or Bat who have bushi in their ranks but lack any bushi school of their own.",

    "description": "Devotion: Shintao\n\nThe Order of the Five Rings was a relatively short-lived sect within the greater Brotherhood of Shinsei that, sadly, gained incredibly notoriety and considerable influence during the Empires sixth century. The orders meteoric rise was largely attributable to its leader, the charismatic monk Gorinno, who had gained the Empires attention when he was consulted by the Emperor himself to assist in determining formal cremation rites for the entire nation. Although he was already known as a wise teacher and gifted orator, this act catapulted Gorinno to an unprecedented position of influence in the Empire. It was from this prominent position that he created both his heretical philosophy and the order of monks who would follow it.\n\nEven in the beginning, the members of the Order of the Five Rings were extremely devoted to their founder, and as the years of the heresy unfolded they became increasingly fervent in their beliefs, almost to the point of acting as a cult. Moderate members of their order were weeded out early on, leaving only zealots and borderline lunatics where there had once been scholars and orators. Once the heresy was concluded, the Empire quickly dissolved the Order of the Five Rings, and it is mentioned only in a few texts within the monastic libraries of the Brotherhood.\n\nMembers of the Order of the Five Rings are notorious for their strange abilities, which permit them to find strength in even the slightest imbalance of the Elements. Normal theological and philosophical doctrines accept that some small degree of imbalance is inevitable (and indeed is a hallmark of humanitys inherent imperfection as a race born from both the blood of Lord Moon and the tears of Lady Sun). However, the monks of the Order of the Five Rings are able to exploit these minor weaknesses in a manner the rest of the Brotherhood cannot replicate or has chosen not to in the years since the Orders demise.",

    "description": "Adherents of the Shrine of Heavens Mirror seek to extend their perceptions beyond the ordinary reality of Ningen-do. To this end, they cultivate the ability to enter a trance-state to become more receptive to the guidance of the Fortunes, spirits, and other outside forces. They will deprive themselves of sleep for days on end, drink alcohol to the point of delirium, dance with wild and exhausting abandon, and consume hallucinogenic plants. In return, they gain unusual insight into all forms of divination, especially the interpretation of omens.\n\nYou must be Ascetic and follow the peculiar practices of the Heavens Mirror sect, regardless of the social consequences of doing so.\n\nFailing to embrace these practices will result in your losing the benefits of your School Technique, and may also result in expulsion from this sect.",

The temple itself was ancient when the Lady Doji first approached it, having been created by primitive men to revere the oldest of the Fortunes.\n\nThese monks and their studies aided the Lady Doji in the promotion of culture throughout the Empire, and in the process their temple became something of a sensation in early Rokugan, affording the brothers there an unexpected amount of social prestige and influence. This was something of an anomaly in the early Brotherhood and created some difficulties for the sect, but in the intervening centuries the impact of monks upon Rokugan’s society has long since been accepted by the Brotherhood’s leadership",

The Brotherhood seized upon the practice of archery as a way for these unfortunates to find both spiritual focus and purpose, leading to the creation of the Wind’s Grace Order, a new sect with strong ties to the Asahina family and to other prominent archery traditions throughout the Empire, including both the Dragon and the Mantis. Through focus and proper contemplation, the once-lost brothers managed to recover from the horrors of the Clan War and resume the long path toward enlightenment.\n\nMembers of the Asahina family may potentially attend this school.",
