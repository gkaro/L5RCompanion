Great numbers of samurai from all walks of life who have fallen to the Shadowlands Taint or succumbed to the worship of Fu Leng have embraced the philosophy and methodology of the Dark Lord Daigotsu, and eagerly enact his sinister will without consideration for their previous families and allies. Not all Daigotsu are Tainted, but a large majority of them have felt Jigoku’s sinister touch."

GMs and players can make use of the Yotsu in many different eras of play, and they can also serve as a template for the depiction of ronin families in other eras of play as well."
