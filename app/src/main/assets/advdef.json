Its presence breaks you out in a very uncomfortable rash, which in turn makes others react poorly to your presence.\n* Lingering Misfortune: At some point in your future, you will fail an extremely important dice roll in a spectacularly disastrous fashion. The GM will decide when this happens, and no mechanical effect will allow you to overcome it or to circumvent it.\n* Unknown Enemy: Someone somewhere in another Clan hates you, and wishes to see you dead.

You suffer a penalty of -1k0 to any roll made to resist acquiring the Taint. Only members of the Unicorn Clan may take this Disadvantage, and they receive 4 points for it.\n* Yogo Curse: You are cursed to betray the one you love the most, just as the first Yogo was cursed by Fu Leng himself.
